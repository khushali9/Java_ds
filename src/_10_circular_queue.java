//In  a standard queue data structure re-buffering problem occurs for each  dequeue operation. To solve this problem by joining the front and rear  ends of a queue to make the queue as a circular queue
//Circular queue is a linear data structure. It follows FIFO principle.
  //  In      circular queue the last node is connected back to the first node to make a      circle.
   // Circular      linked list fallow the First In First Out principle
    //Elements      are added at the rear end and the elements are deleted at front end of the      queue
    //Both      the front and the rear pointers points to the beginning of the array.
    //It      is also called as “Ring buffer”.
    //Items      can inserted and deleted from a queue in O(1) time.
